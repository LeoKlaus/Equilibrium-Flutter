# Equilibrium Flutter App

This is a Flutter based client for the API of [Equilibrium](https://github.com/LeoKlaus/Equilibrium), an open source universal remote control.
If you don't know about Equilibrium, I recommend [taking a look at that project first](https://github.com/LeoKlaus/Equilibrium), as this app can only be used with an Equilibrium hub.

Currently, I'm only testing this on Android and Chrome/Safari but building for Windows and Linux should be possible without (major) modifications.
If you're looking for an iOS app, I suggest using [Equilibrium-iOS](https://github.com/LeoKlaus/Equilibrium-iOS), but you may also try build the Flutter app if you hate native apps.


## Contributing

This is my first time using Flutter so expect mediocre code quality at best. If you'd like to contribute a feature, please fork this repo and create a PR.

## Installation

As of now, I don't distribute binaries for this app, as it is still missing a lot of content. If you still want to try it, you have to install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and build it yourself.
